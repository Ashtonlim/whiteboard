This lesson is on control structures branching. There are five main sections to cover flood control structures branching. This video lesson focuses on the third part. Nested if statements. Learning Objectives. After this lesson. You should be able to. Explain how nested IF statement works with example. The nest to the if statement. The nest to give statement allows us to perform and multiple ways selection. In a nest to the if statement. Both the if branch and the else branch may contain one or more if statements. The level of nested if statements can be as many as the limit. The compiler allows. C compiler associates and else part with the nearest unresolved if. That is the if statement that does not have an L statement. We can also use braces to enclose statements. In the example program. The purpose is to determine the maximum value of three input numbers. This program reads send three individuals from the user and stores the values in the variables and 1. And 2 and then 3. If anyone is greater than n2. Then one is compared with then 3. If any one is greater than N3. Then Max is assigned with the value of anyone. Otherwise. Max is assigned with the value of n 3. On the other hand. If then one is less than N2 then then n2 is compared with then a 3 in a similar manner. The variable Max is assigned with the value based on the comparison between then two and then three. Finally. The program will print the maximum value of the three integers by the variable Max. In summary. After viewing this video lesson. You just should be able to explain nested if statements with examples.
